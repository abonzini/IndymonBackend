Need to manually ensure in team calc:
- Status move penalty depending on mon slot (to avoid status spam in the last slot or setting shit status)
- Calculate weight/speed diff BPs properly
- Calculate multistrike properly
- Calculate fixed damage properly
- Sub 60 removal in some variable effects
- Swap of stats, body press, foul play
- Stab
- Adaptability
- Tinted lens i think it is
- Tera based Stab
- Status setup requires improvement, same as set defined items
- Damage formula considering typecharts, immunity bypass
- Specific behaviour for freeze dry
- Revelation dance
- Trick room inverting speeds
- Diminish stabs of same cat to ensure more variety
