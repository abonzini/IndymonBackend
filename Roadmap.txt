// REWoRK
Ability + Moves are now weighted, e.g. Tackle 100, Surf 100. Weight is modified for damage (more damage BP*Stat = more chance), and beneficial effects by particular cases

Mon can take items (of any type, seen separately) before or after set, considering same P of taking item before, so that
P1 (pre set) = P/2
P2 (post set) = (P/2)/(1-P1)

Pre and post item acceptance is different, a pre item implies set may be biased towards item, e.g. favoring consume abilities, recycle if berry, etc, rest if chesto and so on, same as favored abilities
So, take item and thsi will modify weights

Later on, ability + move selection starts to take place, moves are initially pushed to fulfill conditions such as
1 - Move Disks
2 - Legal stab
3 - Format rules
With the corresponding weights, it'll be a system of intersection and unions to determine what is possible and then score wise.
Rest of slots are filled, while random pick influences future weights (e.g. rest gives snore a high chance, etc), Normalize gives all moves stab, etc

Finally, taking item post set involves only adding items that are useful, this would include plate only if multipliers, MOD only if helps, etc
This results in a "smart" but random set with decent coverage, etc. Eventually more item sets can be added and modified and so on.
This may be computationally more crazy but may be cool too so why not.
It is the amin focus of S2, a great teambuilder

// TODO
Load data in sheet, will take a while. Do in order:
- Moves (interact with moves and items)
- Revise items, MOVE_AFFECTING_ITEM has been included to filter out items meant to boost moves in order to discard them if useless. Do another round, examine which ones actually do boost stuff, and also transfer the "attacking boost" thing to the actual calculation, only defensive is needed otherwise
Ask yourself, what can buff/nerf these? AND do they need to discourage elements of similar types?
