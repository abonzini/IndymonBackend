TODO:
- Finish indymon season
- Debugging of teambuilder, have a tournament working. Phase 1 complete.
- Trainer string builder. Pre-event (used favour), post-event (item consumption). Event string of ongoing event. Class and the tourn/expl will hold it, can be obtained. TOURN or EXPL result files
- Then, trainer stuff consumed, arithmetic and exporting, one per trainer. File exported as TRAINER_NEW output
- Incorporate logic mod items, more sophisticated class system, maybe a logic flag instead of referencing item by name. Merge current bot
- Reincorporate exploration manager, redo exploration manager context to include "buffable" exploration contexts (e.g. shiny stone)
- Revise manager, fix whats wrong, team builder based on whats in the exploration, make it build too
- Save/load expl stuff in own folder, similarly, just store teambuild seed for trainer, all can be generated from this
- Use dungeon modifiers, add modifier (archetype) to dungeon. Add better chance-based system of items, to get variable numbers. May just remove the chances and yolo (Shiny Stone)
- At this point indymon should be working? Test for a while
- Option to consume favour
- Option to consume + explore favour
- Option to grant random pokemon
