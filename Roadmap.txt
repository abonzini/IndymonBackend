Need to manually ensure in team calc:
- Setup (and speed setup) increasing their respective utility. Add defensive setup? Same idea? >1.1 or sth

Distant future (ideas):
-	Make nat power, camouflage use the correct stuff both in calcs (archetype, no prob) and custom showdown. Showdown: Custom format like force monotype, string as value. Field has camouflage type string as value. On constructor, check if value of rule retreived and replaced in field. Camouflage takes stirng instead of normal. Every dungeon has a camuflage type.
	As to how modify the mods, maybe can hardcode them in the mod table (ugly) or add additional mods on launch (less ugly and already implemented in archetypes and such)
