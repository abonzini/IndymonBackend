// REWoRK
ok so, instead of eac h mon legal stabs do each type stabs and assign intersections mon vs each of types
add tera type as stab

check:
item pre check -> mod+equip (manually here or auto item too) -> Non-conditional items or definer items (e.g. if lagging tail here it favors specific moves), if 

moveset define, a bit more complex it can be, maybe scoring them or w/e

last item define, (if auto item), etc

=> Algo:
legal stab is 100
moves of interest, e.g. if rest then the sleeps, if chesto then rest, etc

=> Def need better move data parsing no matter what (redo move importer and stop using csv) but also extract properties (sound, contact, whatever), BP, and use it for complex scoring

=> Is item useful would have been item->moves->yes/no but more importatnyl item is linked with moves/ability and so, 
lsit [move/score] -> water gun, 0, rest 10
chesto: water gun, 0, rest 20 etc
better move importer too
etc
As a move is decided (one by one), this may affect other moves too=> algorithm is based on scoring moves against ability and/or item, and other moves as It goes along. Result is a set with random stuff but may contain good stuff too
The moveset first tries to make sure to get the requirements (e.g. stabs and filter stuff) and only then fills with random remaining
Finally one last item pass to decide if an item is useful to use afterwards given chances too
