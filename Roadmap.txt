Need to manually ensure in team calc:
- Setup (and speed setup) increasing their respective utility. Add defensive setup? Same idea? >1.1 or sth

Distant future (ideas):
-	To do next time a player selects nature power/secret power or camouflage (or random person explore)
	Exploration/Arena terrain info. Have an extra flag in ps.field which is something like arena-tag. Load arena tag from custom rule.
	Custom ruleset, identical to "Force Monotype". Field loads it like "this.ruleTable.valueRules.get('arenatagmod')"
	Modifies:
		- Camouflage type
		- Nature Power move
		- Secret power effect
		- Let default be, as before, tri-attack/paralysis/normal (??), and then else if chain
		- Add mod to all dungeons
