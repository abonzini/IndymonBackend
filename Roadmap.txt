Need to manually ensure in team calc:
- Archetype based type changes, e.g. castform, mimicry (or whatever stunfisk does), possibly conversion and those things
- Tinted lens i think it is
- Damage formula considering typecharts, immunity bypass
- Specific behaviour for freeze dry
- Trick room inverting speeds
- Diminish stabs of same cat to ensure more variety
- Status discard
- Coverage small bonus
